A {{user_type_name}}({{user_name}}) viewed your application.

    Hi {{tenant_name}}, we detected a visit on your profile on {{ date_time | date:"D d M Y"}} due to an application to {{property_name}}. They're probably reviewing all applicants information, so make sure all of your data is updated on our system.

                  And also remember to check {{host_name}} for recently added properties. You will certainly find something interesting.

                    Thanks,
